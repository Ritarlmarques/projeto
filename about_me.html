         <h2>Hello there!</h2>

         <p>I'm a Junior Product Designer from Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
      
         <p>I work on end-to-end projects, from research and problem recognition, to visual design, prototyping and testing. I also want to keep developing in other fields such as illustration, branding and motion. With a curious, responsible and creative mindset, I’m ready to improve, work with new people and give my best in every challenge.</p>
